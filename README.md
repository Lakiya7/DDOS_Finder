# DDOS_Finder
Welcome to the repository for "DDOS Finder - DDoS Detection and Prevention in IoT Devices (IP Cameras)."

This project is focused on providing a comprehensive software solution to detect and prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly IP cameras. Leveraging scalable data ingestion techniques and adaptive machine learning models, the solution achieves high accuracy in detecting and preventing DDoS attacks.

Features:

•	 Scalable data ingestion from diverse IoT devices
•	Adaptive machine learning model for evolving attack patterns
•	High detection accuracy (99.55%) using RandomForestClassifier
•	Real-time telemetry data analysis and visualization
•	Comprehensive classification results and accuracy reports
•	Google Authentication integration via Firebase
•	User-friendly interface using Flask and HTML/CSS
